			  	<p>思考身边存在着什么样的问题，如何用创造性的方式去解决这些问题。</p>

<hr/>

<p>They were encouraged to be entrepreneurial by identifying opportunities, challenging assumptions, leveraging the limited resources they had, and by being creative. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 41-42 </p>

<hr/>

<p>They understood that five dollars is essentially nothing and decided to reinterpret the problem more broadly: What can we do to make money if we start with absolutely nothing? They ramped up their observation skills, tapped into their talents, and unlocked their creativity to identify problems in their midst—problems they experienced or noticed others experiencing—<strong>problems they might have seen before but had never thought to solve</strong>. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 50-53 </p>

<hr/>

<p>They soon realized that they were providing a convenient and valuable service. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 69-70 </p>

<hr/>

<p>At any place and time you can look around and identify problems that need solving. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 116-116 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Regardless of the size of the problem, there are usually creative ways to use the resources already at your disposal to solve them. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 119-120 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Colleagues use for entrepreneurship: an entrepreneur is someone who is always on the lookout for problems that can be turned into opportunities and finds creative ways to leverage limited resources to reach their goals. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 120-122 </p>

<hr/>

<p>They don’t step back and look at the problem more broadly. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 124-125 </p>

<hr/>

<p>The overarching goal is to demonstrate that all problems can be viewed as opportunities for creative solutions. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 127-128 </p>

<hr/>

<p>We strive to create “T-shaped people,” <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 137-137 </p>

<hr/>

<p>In fact, entrepreneurship cultivates a range of important life skills, from leadership and team building to negotiation, innovation, and decision making. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 140-141 </p>

<hr/>

<p>In fact, the rules that apply in school are often completely different from those in the outside world. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 153-153 </p>

<hr/>

<p>In fact, real life is the ultimate open book exam. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 162-163 </p>

<hr/>

<p>The key to success is the ability to extract the lessons out of each of these experiences and to move on with that new knowledge. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 170-171 </p>

<hr/>

<p>It is essentially our responsibility to pick our own direction. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 173-174 </p>

<p>Notes: 1) 自可做决定自己承担后果</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why don’t most of us view problems as opportunities in our everyday lives? Why did the teams described previously have to wait for a class assignment to stretch the limits of their imaginations?</strong> <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 188-189 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Notes: 用你学科的思维方式去思考如何解决社会上存在的问题。</p>

<p>That is, we can choose to view the world through different lenses—lenses that allow us to see problems in a new light. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 196-196 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Ask them to identify a problem, and then pick a random object in their environment. They then need to figure out how that object will help them solve the problem. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 237-238 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Postgraduates who have studied engineering, medicine, and business come together for a year to identify significant needs in medicine and then design products to address them. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 251-252 </p>

<hr/>

<p>They whittle a list of hundreds of needs to just a handful, with the goal of picking the biggest problems they can find. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 256-257 </p>

<p>breakthrough invention, most cardiologists felt that the only way to deal with clogged arteries was to do bypass surgery to remove the damaged blood vessels. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 262-263 </p>

<hr/>

<p>The key to need finding is identifying and filling gaps—that is, gaps in the way people use products, gaps in the services available, and gaps in the stories they tell when interviewed about their behavior. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 278-279 </p>

<hr/>

<p>They were selling diapers as though they were hazardous waste disposal devices. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 284-285 </p>

<hr/>

<p>I then ask them to turn these things upside down—to imagine the exact opposite of each one. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 301-301 </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The key is to take the time to clearly identify every assumption.</strong> <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 307-308 </p>

<hr/>

<p>The sweet spot is where your passions overlap with your skills and the market. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1121-1122 </p>

<hr/>

<p>The wisdom of this is reflected in the observation that hard work plays a huge part in making you successful. And, the truth is, we simply tend to work harder at things we’re passionate about. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1128-1129 </p>

<hr/>

<p>it was surprisingly difficult for me to separate what I wanted for myself and what others wanted for me. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1179-1179 </p>

<hr/>

<p>but if you really wanted to deliver you’d figure out a way to make it happen. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1836-1837 </p>

<hr/>

<p>You need to come to terms with the fact that if you really want to accomplish something, it’s up to you to do so. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1839-1840 </p>

<hr/>

<p>Again, achieving is your responsibility from start to finish. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1843-1844 </p>

<hr/>

<p>By that I mean, give yourself permission to challenge assumptions, to look at the world with fresh eyes, to experiment, to fail, to plot your own course, and to test the limits of your abilities. <br/>
Tina Seelig, What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, loc. 1950-1951 </p>
